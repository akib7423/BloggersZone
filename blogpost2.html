            In the modern age of technology, people are always looking for new features and the interesting fact is, people don’t know actually what they want. On a result, if someone able to introduce them with a new feature which holds a good efficiency as well,
            they will definitely go for it. Smart elevator locating system is exactly that sort of new feature, which is able to save time along with ensuring people’s comfort. Reduced passenger waiting times, increased customer’s spending time capability
            in emerging markets and overall improvement of global economies are some of key drivers of Smart Elevator [1]. The main problem of this idea is how we can read data from the display precisely and send it to the website. Along with this, it
            is also a problem to implement the device in a way that it can be fitted with the elevator display perfectly. In this case, the possible solution of reading data is using pi camera and raspberry pi. Raspberry Pi will also able to send data
            to firebase for upgrading database and that database will send to the website. In future, integrating of this model to elevator system could take the thought of using elevator in another percept. The model also can be used in a commercial
            way. <br>
            <br> As previously mentioned, components of this device is Raspberry Pi, Pi Camera and LCD Display. These hardware devices are fitted inside of a rectangular box made by PVC Board with a LCD display infront of it so that user can see the lift
            position through the display. This device is very much easy to carry and can be fitted infront of elevator’s display very easily. Basically, Pi Camera helps to read the position and send the update to Raspberry Pi. After reading the data,
            the turn of showing the data to the users comes. For this, a particular website has been made. So that, people can go to that website, create their profile and can log in to see the elevator’s position. <br>
            <br> The implementation of our project has been done in some phases. Digital Image processing is used to implement the project. The work has been done in Open CV where a built in library is also available. Taking reference images, converting
            real time and reference both images into gray scale, comparing real time pictures with reference pictures, displaying current location and sending location to website are the parts which splitted into particular phases. A. Taking Reference
            Images At first, it is important to take reference pictures from the Elevator’s display as reference images and save it to raspberry pi so that Real time images can be compared with those reference images later. B. Converting Images into gray
            scale Converting color image into gray scale is necessary to reduce the noise margin. Without this, it won’t be possible get the proper output through real time data and reference as well. To reduce noise margin, the device have to set in
            such way that other lights or object don’t come between the camera and the elevator display. C. Comparing reference images with real time images The basic concept of this project is converting both real time and reference images into gray
            scale and comparing those images. Reducing noise margin is very much necessary to get the accurate data else images can’t be compared accurately and will get wrong output through the code as well. When Pi Camera capture a real time image and
            it’s been converted into gray scale, the generated code started comparing the gray-scaled image with the stored gray-scaled reference image. When the real time image matched with the reference image, the output comes out which is considered
            as current location. D. Displaying current Location It is necessary to make reference images labeled accordingly to their actual value. As example, 1 should be stored as 1, 9 should be stored as 9. So that, when real time image will be matched
            with the reference image, the number label can be showed as the output through the LCD monitor and also in the website because this is the floor location where the elevator is actually situated. E. Show the location to website For showing
            location into website firebase has been used. Firstly, the info of current location is being stored in the Raspberry Pi. Raspberry Pi sends the data to firebase and firebase starts updating the database. After that, the updated database goes
            to the website and users are able to see it. <br>
            <br> There were some problems which were faced while observing the result. Sometimes, actual result has not been got and it is happening because of noise margin as it lets unwanted figure to come out at the gray scale image and that is why
            images cannot be compared correctly. Actually, the code can’t identify seven segments for the noise here. However, we got almost 90% accuracy while a test run was made. Sometimes, accuracy was even finer as we tried to keep least noise margin.
            With this analysis it has been realized that, it is very important to fix the device with elevator display perfectly and also have to make sure so that it remains still all the time. Only then 100% accuracy had been got which actually happened
            by keeping noise margin in control.<br>
            <br> A smart elevator locating system has been made with Raspberry Pi, Pi Camera & LCD Display which can easily tell us the location of an elevator. These features will bring a huge advantage among people by making sure of their relaxation,
            saving times and in many other ways. It’s a new integration to IOT as well. This device can be used in a commercial sector as well. Elevator companies are going to accept it happily as this is going to enhance their elevator’s features. So,
            they will be getting benefited as well. Most important thing is, Smart Elevator Locating System can be very much helpful in hazardous situations. A building might get fire or during earthquake or any other hazards, it might be possible that
            people cannot track the elevator location by entering into the building. On that case, users can get track easily from outside by entering the website. In future, this project has a vision to enhance the device more. Elevator’s estimated time
            of going from one floor to another can be calculated also or detecting the elevator is full or not, live navigation of the elevators are some amusing ideas which will definitely increase people’s interest to this device.
