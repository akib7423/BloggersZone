            “Politics is who gets what, when, how” – Harold Lasswell. Bangladesh is known as a democratic nation and the democracy of our nation is very much attached with student politics. Politics is very much important to drive a nation in a right track but if
            the question is risen that does our politics is going in a right track? I am afraid most of the cases the answer will be no. It is very much important to find out the problems behind it and work on this immediately. Aggressive student politics
            is one of the most important issues for what the whole political system is losing track day by day. Surprisingly, this student politics played a big role to take our country in this present situation as well and that is why it is high time
            to think about student politics and work on it. Aggressive student politics is one of the biggest threats to our democracy also. Basically, people do politics on the basis of one particular party so does the students and unfortunately, the
            motive of politics has been turned into ensure the interest of that one particular party now a days. However, ensuring that interest of particular party has started to be the cause of sufferings to the civilians. <br>
            <br> History of student politics began since the British period and it put its significance in Pakistan period and After Pakistan period also. Actually, student politics helped us to achieve many important interests in earlier days. If we
            watch carefully, students had a big role in both 1952 and 1971. Even after independence, student movement was so much important to get back the democracy in earlier nineties. The real problem began when the two party rules finally started
            after 1990. Lacking of true leadership pushed students in a chaotic situation and they started to show dominance over each other by keeping these two big political parties in their back. The student policy agenda was twofold in the ' 60s and
            ' 80s: the educational agenda and the national political agenda. Over the past two decades, the ruling's major student organizations and major opposition parties have shown little appetite for academic issues, while narrowly defined partisan
            interests have overwhelmed national political issues. Bangladesh Chhatra League, Bangladesh Jatiotabadi Chhatra Dol, Bangladesh Islami Chhatra Shibir are the main political organization formed by students. In present, situation is even more
            dangerous, their aggressiveness has been crossed all previous boundaries that even civilians have to be victimized for them and that’s where the threat to democracy begins.<br>
            <br> Campus violation is one of the biggest problems which have been come out through aggressive student politics. Around 150 students were injured on 31 January, 1996 and about ninety-five arrested at Jagannath University. Over 147 killed
            only in five institutions since liberation. Inspite of being innocent, many people have to surrender their life because of the fight of student political parties. Incidents happened few days ago in BUET where student named Abrar Fahad was
            killed by some Chhatra League supported students of that same campus. We can also talk about quota movement happened earlier where students involving with the movement was attacked by ruling political party supported students. The protests
            on campus should go smoothly as it was on behalf of student’s interests rather than any political issues but the aggressiveness didn’t let it happen. Similar incidents happened by Chhatra Dol and Shibir when BNP was in power also. Ragging
            is another issue where students try to show dominance in campus especially in public universities by keeping political back up by their side. Along with this, Schools and colleges are not also out of this violation as students are getting
            involved with politics from their school level by not even understanding the depth of it. <br>
            <br> This aggressive student politics has also become the reason of headache for civilians. Every time, if any injustice happened, people start protesting. However, their protest doesn’t go smoothly every time. Definitely, road safety protests
            happened in Bangladesh was not for any political interest and it can be said with certainty that maximum people of that movement was not belong to any political parties. But these students were attacked by Bangladesh Chhatra League (BCL) brutally.
            Unfortunately, some of attacks were made by police and BCL force together or we can say it BCL under the banner of police. Where civilians have to face violence from police with some political force, the question is risen definitely on that
            country’s democracy. Bishwajit Das was killed brutally by Awami League’s student wing Bangladesh Chhatra League only because they suspected him as a member of Jamaat Shibir. The anti-government protests was mostly driven by student political
            parties composed of Chhatro Dol and Shibir where many civilians have to die by burning in the bus. But both of students’ and civilians’ fate should not be like that. “Why students have to come on streets and burn the bus and why people have
            to die in the bus by burning”- this question must be asked to the democracy of our country as vision of student politics never was that. Apart from this, extortion, teasing and many other crimes are happening under the banner of student political
            parties.
            <br>
            <br> It’s a common culture now a days that dominance have to show in national elections and the cultures has been continuing since 1996 till now. Ruling party always tries to create such environment that election result can go to their favor
            always. For this, students belonging to that party are mostly involved. If we study 1996,2001,2009,2014 or 2018 elections, Chhatra Dol or Chhatra League was involved everywhere by robbing ballots, forced normal people to not give votes or
            creating violence. Armed motorcyclists aren't always targeting a U.S. diplomat, but that's exactly what happened to Marcia Bernicat, Washington's envoy in Bangladesh just right before the election. Along with national elections if we observe
            recently happened DUCSU election, violence also happened here. Elected VP Nur was attacked several times by his opponents on different issues. Besides this, it is also heard to force students to not giving their votes or change their votes.
            Election is the most important process to ensure democracy but the aggressiveness doesn’t let it happen this also. <br>
            <br> After the problematic situation occurred by aggressive student politics, the fact has been risen that should student politics be banned? Different people have different opinions on it. Mir Mosharref Hossain Pakbir who is the Vice-Chairman
            of Democratic Research Center said that every single person who have the right to vote, have also the right to do politics. He also added that most of the violence in campus is occurring because of the influence of VC, Pro-VC, hall provost,
            and proctor who try to turn things on their side. He continued suggesting that, for the sake of a professional next generation, no teacher will patronize any political ideology on campus and finished by saying that student leaders should be
            chosen by election not selection. Consequently, Professor Serajul Islam Chowdhury also suggested to not banning student politics after Abrar Fahad incidents and said to make students politics autonomous rather than keeping it under any political
            parties. Dr Syed Manzoorul Islam told to keep politics away under the wing of BNP and Awami League and work on unprivileged people’s rights. <br>
            <br> It is not possible to change the political cultures in a night. The way our two main political parties always compete to show the dominance, it will not let the student politics to be purified easily. There was a time when a good students
            used to be good politician but now worst one is leading the party. So, it won’t be easy to change the system. We are far away from true democracy. Because of this, a wrong stereotype is buzzing around everywhere which intends people to go
            towards violence. Actually, our country culture is corrupted badly and a student is being nurtured with that culture which will be slowing down the purification. <br>
            <br> Politics is not harmful for students until it gets aggressive. So, the target and vision of politics should be changed rather than banning it. Student politics have to be ensured only for student’s rights and for the larger interest of
            the country. Showing dominance by staying under the powerful political party’s wing is not a good practice at all and here democracy getting unjustified. Student politics has a glory before and reforming the student politics can get back that
            glory as well as remove the violation from student politics with ensuring democracy.
